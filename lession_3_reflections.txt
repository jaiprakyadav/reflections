When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we need to share our code with other person sitting remotely.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because we might lose the commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are repository to keep files by other user account on github, clones are used to copy reposotry be it local to local or local to remote or remote to local. Branches are labels to commit.
